[BetterLoading] One or more mods have Harmony-Postfixed StaticConstructorOnStartupUtility#CallAll. This is likely to cause errors or undesired behavior, as BetterLoading changes this method to be called from another Thread than the UI one. A list of patches follows. 
(Filename: C:\buildslave\unity\build\Runtime/Export/Debug/Debug.bindings.h Line: 39)

[BetterLoading] In addition, when BetterLoading is installed, this postfix will run before any static constructors do, so it likely will not behave as the modder intended anyway.

[BetterLoading] Modders: Consider either loading this data on world load, using a regular static constructor but asking your users to put the mod last in the load order, or if it MUST be done now, consider using BetterLoading API to detect the start of StageRunPostFinalizeCallbacks, which fires once static constructors are done.
